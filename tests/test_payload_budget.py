"""Ceiling on the LLM-facing payload: tool docstrings + handshake instructions.

Every MCP session ships every tool description plus INSTRUCTIONS before any
work happens. After a three-pass docstring diet, the payload is approximately
15.5k estimated tokens — a fixed tax on every conversation. This test freezes
a ceiling just above the measured size so growth is a deliberate decision (bump
the constant in the same PR, with justification), and the ceiling ratchets DOWN
as further trims land.

Token estimate: len(chars) / 4 — crude but stable, and only deltas matter.
Docstrings are collected via AST rather than SDK introspection so the test
does not depend on MCP SDK internals.

# Ceiling, in estimated tokens (chars/4). Measured 2026-08-07 after the
# tool-consolidation series' third and final commit (`nodes(action=...)`,
# 47 -> 39 tools): ~13.84k (39 tool docstrings, 40248 doc chars + INSTRUCTIONS
# 15126 chars). Ratcheted 17,000 -> 15,000 accordingly — comfortably above the
# measurement so ordinary edits never trip it while real growth does. Ratchet
# DOWN as the docstring diet lands; never bump without stating why in the same
# PR.
#
# 15,000 -> 15,250 when `nodes` documented `is_api_node` / `exclude_api`: that
# paragraph is ~130 tokens and the tree was ALREADY at 14,984, so the slack the
# ratchet was set with had been spent by intervening docstring growth rather
# than by this change. Measured ~15,112 after it. Deliberately tight — the
# point of this ceiling is that the next growth is a decision too, not that
# there is room for one.
#
# 15,250 -> 15,600 for `workflow_compose` (39 -> 40 tools), the first tool here
# that BUILDS a graph rather than editing an existing one: it wraps comfy-cli
# 1.16.0's `workflow compose` / `decompose` / `fragment ls|show|validate`.
# Measured ~15,465 after it, against 137 tokens of headroom before — so the
# bump is the decision this ceiling exists to force, not an accident.
#
# Two things were done to keep it this small, and a reviewer should hold a
# future authoring change to the same bar:
#   - ONE grouped tool (`action=...`, the `nodes`/`job`/`download` shape) rather
#     than five thin ones. Five separate docstrings measured ~+800 tokens
#     against this one's ~+353; the five verbs share `lib_dir` and a single
#     workflow, so the grouping is the honest shape as well as the cheap one.
#   - INSTRUCTIONS deliberately UNTOUCHED (its own module comment says "keep
#     this short"). The library-bootstrap story — comfy-cli ships zero
#     fragments, so `decompose` is the on-ramp — lives in the tool docstring and
#     the README, which costs no per-session tokens.
# The ratchet intent is unchanged: trim back DOWN when the next diet lands.

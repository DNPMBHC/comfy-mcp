"""Tests for the opt-in local rotating failure log (``COMFY_MCP_DEBUG_LOG``).

The log exists to give a tester a durable, zippable diagnostic trail for
comfy-cli failures, so these tests hold its three defining properties:

1. **Opt-in.** With the env var unset there are ZERO filesystem effects — no
   directory, no handler, no file — even when comfy-cli fails.
2. **Failure-only.** A successful call writes nothing, and neither does a
   pre-flight validation raise (which never spawned comfy-cli at all).
3. **Structured + scrubbed.** Every line is pure JSON with the failure's
   ``kind`` / ``args`` / ``exit_code`` / ``error_code`` / stream tails, and a URL
   argument is logged with its userinfo masked and its query string dropped.

Like the rest of the suite these mock comfy-cli; nothing here needs a real
``comfy`` binary.

"""Regression tests for the comfy-cli invocation and output collection.

These lock in the two behaviors that actually broke during development:
1. comfy-cli's global flags (``--json``, ``--where``) MUST precede the
   subcommand — a trailing ``--json`` errors with "No such option".
2. ``fetch_outputs`` is a thin passthrough to
   ``comfy download <prompt_id> --where local -o <dir>`` — comfy-cli owns the
   local download, so the tool only maps its argv (no hand-rolled HTTP client).

Plus the streaming ``run_workflow(wait=True)`` path: it drives
``comfy --json-stream … run --wait`` via Popen, forwards NDJSON run events as
MCP progress notifications, and still returns the final envelope's data.

    necessarily already sampled. That turns the herd tests from "sleep long

    `_version_probe_starts` and BEFORE its bound starts running — an ordering,
    not a race the staging thread has to win. `_waiter_that_gives_up` is the

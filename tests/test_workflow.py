"""Tests for the ``comfy workflow`` tools — list / set-slot / vary / notes / compose.

These lock in the passthrough argv (global flags before the subcommand, same
rule the wrapper enforces) for the tools that let an agent parameterize a
fetched template — the ``fetch_template`` -> ``set_workflow_slot`` ->
``run_workflow`` loop — without hand-editing raw workflow JSON, plus
``list_workflow_notes``, the read-only reader for the authored documentation
that same template carries, and ``workflow_compose``, the one tool here that
BUILDS a graph rather than editing one. The behaviors they own on top of the
passthrough:
1. ``set_workflow_slot`` passes each override as a positional ``ADDR=VALUE`` and
   defaults to ``--stdout`` (non-destructive), togglable off.
2. ``vary_workflow`` repeats ``--slot`` per address and forwards ``--out-dir``
   only when given.
3. ``vary_workflow`` pre-checks each slot entry's value against the JSON-array
   contract comfy-cli enforces, so an unquoted comma-bearing prompt is named
   here instead of failing opaquely (or behind a server-connection error) later.
4. ``list_workflow_notes`` degrades to the ``unsupported`` shape on a comfy-cli
   that predates the ``workflow notes`` verb, instead of relaying Click's raw
   usage dump — the common case while the verb is newer than the version floor
   — and refuses to fire that degrade for a phrase Click merely echoed back out
   of the caller's own ``workflow_path``.
5. ``workflow_compose`` maps its five ``action`` values onto two different
   comfy-cli shapes — ``workflow compose``/``decompose`` take a positional path,
   the three library actions go through the ``workflow fragment`` sub-typer —
   names the action in every rejection (missing required param, param the action
   ignores), and degrades per verb, since the whole fragment group ships in
   comfy-cli 1.16.0, ABOVE this repo's version floor.

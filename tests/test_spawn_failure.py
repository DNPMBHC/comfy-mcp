"""A comfy-cli child that never STARTS still fails as a ``ComfyCliError``.

Each of the four spawn sites (``_run_comfy_raw``, ``_run_comfy_async``,
``_run_comfy_streaming``, ``_start_login``) calls its constructor OUTSIDE the
``try`` that guards the rest of the run — everything after a successful spawn
already has a handler, and a spawn that raised has no child to reap. An
exception from the constructor itself therefore used to escape unconverted: no
``ComfyCliError``, no failure-log line, just an ``OSError`` surfacing as an
internal error.

Reachable because MCP tool arguments cross the wire uncapped for the free-form
values — ``search_models``'s ``query``, a ``run_template`` param — and a big
enough one trips the OS limit on ``execve`` (measured on macOS: a ~2 MiB
argument raises ``OSError: [Errno 7] Argument list too long``). The
pre-spawn guards (``_reject_nul``, ``_guard_arg_len``) still produce the better,
argument-NAMING error first; ``_spawn_failure`` is the backstop underneath them,
so what lands here is what those cannot see.

The unencodable-argument tests drive the REAL refusal rather than injecting the
exception: the conftest fakes render argv with :func:`os.fsencode` exactly as a
POSIX spawn does (``_encode_argv_like_posix``), so a lone surrogate raises
``UnicodeEncodeError`` from the fake spawn where the real one would. A test that
injected the exception would only assert its own premise. Those calls are made
in-process on purpose: the MCP SDK's wire parser rejects a ``\\ud800`` escape as
invalid JSON before a tool ever runs, so a direct call is exactly the layer
these exercise — and the same branch is genuinely reachable over the wire on a
host whose filesystem encoding is not UTF-8, where ordinary non-ASCII in a
free-form value fails ``os.fsencode`` too.

"""comfy-cli argv, path, and input guards — every tool-facing string's last stop before ``subprocess``.

Leaf module over :mod:`comfy_mcp.errors`: it owns the shared argument-injection
and OS-limit defenses (``_reject_nul``, ``_reject_option_like``,
``_reject_nul_deep``, ``_guard_arg_len``, ``_encode_argv``,
``_bounded_timeout``, ``_clip_for_error``) plus every per-domain guard built on
top of them — ``_guard_workflow_path``, ``_guard_blueprint_path``,
``_guard_fragment_name``, ``_guard_lib_dir``, ``_guard_prompt_id``,
``_guard_download_id``, ``_guard_extra_args``, ``_guard_version``,
``_guard_node_names``, ``_guard_log_port`` / ``_render_bad_port``,
``_guard_model_relative_path`` / ``_guard_model_filename``, and
``_validate_upload_paths`` — and their supporting length/shape constants and
regexes. The common thread across all of them: a caller-supplied string that is
too long, embeds a NUL, or opens with a leading dash reaches either
``subprocess`` (a bare, unconverted exception) or comfy-cli (misread as an
option) instead of failing as the :class:`errors.ComfyCliError` every other bad
input produces here — these guards are what makes that failure clean. Nothing
here imports ``server``.

Everything here is private and reached as ``argv._name`` — there is no public
name in this module.

def _reject_option_like(label: str, value: str, expected: str = "") -> str:
    """Reject a leading-dash value comfy-cli would parse as an option, not data.

    Two different jobs share this helper, and the distinction is worth keeping
    straight when adding a call site:

    - **A bare POSITIONAL is an argument-injection vector.** A leading-dash entry
      IS read as a flag, and every later positional shifts up one slot — how
      ``upload_file(paths=["--overwrite"])`` becomes the overwrite flag, and how a
      dash-leading ``workflow_path`` would let the first ``set-slot`` override land
      in the path slot. Guarding these is mandatory.
    - **An option VALUE (``--flag VALUE``) is NOT.** comfy-cli is Click-backed, and
      Click takes the token after a value-taking option verbatim — even one that is
      itself a valid option name (``--out-dir --slot`` parses as
      ``out_dir="--slot"``, not as a missing value). So ``vary_workflow``'s
      ``slots`` / ``out_dir`` are already injection-safe before any guard runs.

    Option values ARE guarded anyway, nearly everywhere in the module
    (``search_templates``'s filters, ``download_model``'s ``relative_path`` /
    ``filename``, ``fetch_template``'s ``out_path``, ``vary_workflow``'s ``slots``
    / ``out_dir``, ``run_workflow`` / ``validate_workflow``'s ``workflow_path``).
    That is input hygiene rather than injection defense: a dash-leading provider
    filter or output filename is a caller mistake, and a named error beats
    comfy-cli matching zero rows, writing a file named ``-x``, or printing
    ``--help`` text that then fails envelope parsing. Read those as
    belt-and-braces, not as evidence that option values are unsafe — the
    distinction above still decides which guards are *mandatory*.

    Two deliberate over-rejections, so neither reads as an oversight:

    - **A lone ``-``.** Click treats it as a positional, not an option, so it is
      not an injection vector. It is refused anyway because it is not a valid
      value at any call site — not a path, template name, node class, connection
      type, or slot address — and "wrote a file named ``-``" is precisely the
      caller mistake the hygiene guards exist to name.
    - **A dash-leading slot ADDR** (``vary_workflow``'s ``slots``). An ``ADDR``
      begins with the node id, which comfy-cli surfaces non-negative via
      ``list_workflow_slots``, so no reachable address starts with ``-``. It also
      costs no capability: ``set_workflow_slot``'s overrides, the structured
      forms' ``address`` (:func:`params._slot_address_arg`), and both param marshalers
      (:func:`params._validate_param_key`) already refuse one, so every other way to
      name a slot in this module rejects it too.

    And one deliberate NON-rejection, which is what "nearly" above is doing:

    - **``search_models``'s ``--text`` query.** The hygiene guards all rest on a
      leading dash never being real DATA for that value, and each leaves an escape
      hatch — ``./-x`` names the same file as ``-x``, which is why the messages
      above suggest it. Neither holds for a free-form substring match over model
      *filenames*: ``-fp16`` / ``-fp8`` / ``-turbo`` are ordinary filename
      substrings, so a dash-leading query matches real rows, and there is no other
      way to spell that substring through ``--text``. Verified against comfy-cli:
      ``models search --text -fp16`` reaches the server call exactly as
      ``--text fp16`` does, so guarding it would refuse a working search rather
      than name a mistake. ``_reject_nul`` still applies there — a NUL cannot ride
      in argv at all. Weigh a new option-value call site the same way before
      copying the hygiene guard into it.

    The echoed value is rendered through :func:`_clip_for_error`, so this message
    honors the module's :data:`errors._MAX_ERROR_FIELD_CHARS` bound like every other
    field that quotes caller input. It is the widest-reach echo in the module —
    over twenty call sites, most of them values with no length cap of their own —
    and a bare ``{value!r}`` would mirror one back whole, ``repr`` escaping
    included (a control character expands 4-to-10x, so even a capped 4096-char
    value can render as ~16 KB). Output is byte-identical to the old ``!r`` for
    anything whose rendered form already fits the bound, which is every real
    argument.

# before it reaches argv, where the OS rejects the exec with an `OSError`
# (`E2BIG`) no caller converts to a :class:`ComfyCliError`.

# ``out_path`` (and its ``workflow_path`` / ``object_info_path``, via
# :func:`_guard_workflow_path`), ``download_model``'s ``relative_path`` and
# ``filename``, ``fetch_template``'s / ``emit_partner_workflow``'s /
# ``partner_generate``'s ``out_path``, ``fetch_outputs``'s and
# ``vary_workflow``'s ``out_dir``, each
# entry of ``upload_file``'s ``paths``, and ``search_models``' ``folder``.
# ``download_model``'s ``url`` is the one path-adjacent value with a ceiling of
# its own (:data:`_MAX_URL_LEN`), passed to the same helper as an explicit
# ``limit``. Keep this list in sync — the SCOPE note at :data:`_MAX_URL_LEN`
# points here for exactly the values that are covered.
#
# ``upload_file``'s ``paths`` is the one entry that needs MORE than this: it is
# splatted into many argv slots, so a per-entry ceiling leaves the sum unbounded
# and :data:`_MAX_UPLOAD_PATHS` / :data:`_MAX_UPLOAD_PATHS_TOTAL_BYTES` bound
# the list itself, the way :data:`_MAX_EXTRA_ARGS` does for ``extra_args``.
#
# It stays this GENEROUS on purpose. It is an argv-safety guard, NOT an attempt
# to close the residual forgery window in :func:`clitext._phrase_is_only_the_caller_s` —
# that discount reads a bounded 500-char message tail, so only a cap BELOW 500
# characters would close it, and that trade-off (refusing legitimately deep
# paths to buy protection from a caller's own crafted argument) is recorded and
# declined in that function's docstring. Do not reopen it by tightening this.
#
# Measured in CHARACTERS, like every id cap above it and unlike
# :data:`params._MAX_PRECHECKED_SLOT_BYTES`, which encodes first because it is sized
# against the kernel's per-argument limit DIRECTLY and has to land on that exact
# boundary. Nothing here does: a character cap is strictly conservative for the
# hazard it guards. Worst case is 4 bytes/character, so 4096 characters is at
# most 16 KiB on the wire — an order of magnitude under Linux's 128 KiB
# `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`. The byte figures the paragraph above cites (`PATH_MAX`,
# `ENAMETOOLONG`) are therefore ANCHORS for where a generous ceiling belongs,
# not boundaries this check claims to sit exactly on: a multibyte path between
# 4096 characters and 4096 bytes rides through and fails as comfy-cli's own
# `ENAMETOOLONG`, which is an ordinary engine error, not the unconverted
# `OSError` this cap exists to prevent.
#
# `PATH_MAX` is also the POSIX figure. Windows with long paths enabled (or a
# `\\?\` prefix) admits up to 32,767 characters, so on that host this cap can
# refuse a path the filesystem would have opened. Accepted: a path that deep is
# not a real caller's, and the alternative — a per-platform ceiling — would make
# the same tool argument legal on one host and not another for no gain, since
# the argv hazard is what is being guarded and it does not vary that way.

# Generous ceiling on `download_model`'s `url`, set the same way
# :data:`_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN` is. 8 KiB sits past the request-line limit
# common HTTP servers enforce (nginx's `large_client_header_buffers` and
# Apache's `LimitRequestLine` both default to 8 KiB), so a URL past this ceiling
# can only be one the remote server would refuse anyway — while real
# HuggingFace / CivitAI URLs, signed and query-tokened forms included, sit far
# below it. What it buys is the same thing the id caps buy: the oversized string
# fails as a clean :class:`ComfyCliError` instead of reaching argv, where the OS
# rejects the exec with an `OSError` no caller converts.
#
# Characters, not bytes, for the reason :data:`_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN` gives:
# 8192 characters is at most 32 KiB on the wire, still well under the 128 KiB
# per-argument argv limit, so the character count is the conservative measure
# and the 8 KiB request-line figure is an anchor rather than a boundary this
# check claims to sit on. (A URL is percent-encoded ASCII on the wire anyway, so
# the two counts coincide for anything a server would actually accept.)
#
# SCOPE: this and `_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN` cover the PATH-SHAPED values, which are
# enumerated at `_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN` rather than described, so the list can be
# checked. `search_models`' `folder` is on it too — a models-subfolder positional
# the sweep's own ticket did not name, added because it is the same shape and the
# same hazard as `relative_path`.
#
# What remains deliberately UNCAPPED is the FREE-FORM half: `search_models`'
# `--text` query, the enumerated `search_templates` / `nodes` filter
# values, the params `_generate_param_args` renders, and `vary_workflow`'s /
# `set_workflow_slot`'s JSON slot. Those are prompt- and query-shaped rather
# than path-shaped, so a path-sized ceiling would be the wrong instrument — it
# would refuse a legitimately long prompt to buy a bound the argv hazard does
# not, on its own, justify putting there.
#
# Be precise about what that leaves open, because the obvious defense of it is
# WRONG: "a caller can spend the same bytes by sending more, smaller values" is
# true of the TOTAL `ARG_MAX` and false of Linux's PER-ARGUMENT `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`
# (128 KiB), which one oversized string trips on its own and which no number of
# smaller ones can reach. So a >128 KiB query, filter value, param or slot does
# still die as the unconverted `OSError` — the residue of this sweep, not
# something it covers. Leaving it is a scope call (these are the values a
# path-sized ceiling would misjudge, and the right bound for them is a separate
# decision), NOT a claim that they are safe. `_MAX_PRECHECKED_SLOT_BYTES` is not
# that bound either: it gates only whether `_reject_non_json_array_slot` bothers
# to PARSE, ABSTAINING above it, and the slot still reaches argv. The
# identifier-shaped names (`fetch_template`'s `name`, a node class name, a slot
# `address`) sit in the same residue for the same reason.
#
# SIZE is not the only axis, and the residue is the same shape on the other one:
# a string that cannot be ENCODED never becomes an argv entry either.
# `_guard_arg_len` runs `_encode_argv` for every value listed at
# `_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN`, so the path-shaped family is covered on BOTH axes; the
# free-form and identifier-shaped values above are uncovered on both. Converting
# the spawn failure itself is what would close the residue on either axis at
# once, and that is deliberately a separate change from this sweep.

    # destination check — it says where the value cannot go, not where it
    # must land — so a SECOND stage after it confines the write to the models
    # tree itself (and refuses the `\` spelling that would let the forwarded
    # value miss that tree anyway); see those checks for why both are needed.
    #
    # Decide this the same way on every host rather than deferring to
    # `os.path.isabs`: the guard runs wherever the MCP server runs, but the
    # write happens wherever comfy-cli runs, so a Windows-shaped escape has
    # to be refused from a POSIX server too (`os.path` is `posixpath` there
    # and sees `\\server\share` as an ordinary directory name).
    #
    # An empty leading segment means the value opened with `/` or `\` — an
    # absolute POSIX path, a UNC root, or a Windows root-relative path like
    # `\evil` (which lands at the root of the *current drive*, outside the
    # models dir). Testing the split segment rather than `ntpath.isabs` also
    # keeps the answer stable across Python versions: 3.13 stopped reporting
    # single-separator paths as absolute, so `ntpath.isabs("\\evil")` is True
    # on 3.10 and False on 3.14 — and CI runs both.
    #
    # `splitdrive` then covers what no separator reveals: a drive-relative
    # `C:evil` resolves against drive C:'s own working directory.
    #
    # Segments are matched as a DOT RUN rather than by `seg == ".."`, because
    # Windows strips trailing spaces and periods from every path component at
    # syscall time (`normpath` does not — it leaves them in place, which is
    # exactly why the string check has to). So `".. "` and `"..."` reach the
    # filesystem as `..` and traverse out of the models dir while comparing
    # unequal to it. `strip(" .")` leaves something behind for any real name
    # — `".hidden"`, `"v1.5"`, `"loras"` — so only those disguised forms fall
    # out empty. Empty segments are skipped so a doubled or trailing slash
    # (`models//loras`, `models/loras/`) keeps working as before; a LEADING
    # empty segment is the separator case `parts[0] == ""` already catches.
    #
    # This deliberately sweeps in a bare `.` component too (`./models`), one
    # step wider than the escape strictly requires. Drawing the line exactly

# Ceilings on `upload_file`'s `paths` LIST, alongside the per-entry
# `_MAX_PATH_ARG_LEN` each path carries. The per-entry cap alone does not bound
# the argv this tool builds: `paths` is the one caller-supplied value here that
# is splatted into MANY argv slots, so a list of individually-legal paths still
# sums past the kernel's TOTAL `ARG_MAX` (256 KiB on macOS, typically 2 MiB on
# Linux) and dies as the `OSError` (`E2BIG`) `_run_comfy_raw` never converts —
# its `try` wraps `communicate()`, not the `Popen(...)` that raises. Bounding
# both the count and the size of a splatted list is the same thing
# `_guard_extra_args` does for `extra_args`, for the same reason.
#
# TWO of them, because either alone leaves the other open: the aggregate bounds
# the path BYTES, and the count bounds the per-entry overhead the aggregate
# cannot see, since `execve` charges a pointer and a terminator per entry (a
# list of a million EMPTY strings sums to zero bytes and still blows the limit).
# `_guard_extra_args` splits the same job differently — count plus PER-ENTRY
# length, no aggregate — so the two are the same pair of concerns rather than
# literally the same pair of caps; its own worst case is a residue of the kind
# the last paragraph describes.
#
# BYTES, not characters, and this is the one place in this module where that
# distinction bites. The per-value ceilings above count characters and say why:
# each sits so far under the limit it is guarding that a 4x UTF-8 expansion
# still cannot reach it. An AGGREGATE has no such headroom — it is sized against
# `ARG_MAX` directly, so 128 KiB of CHARACTERS would be up to 512 KiB of
# multibyte path on the wire and would sail past the very limit it exists to
# hold. Measured with `os.fsencode`, which is what `subprocess` itself uses to
# render argv, so the count is the kernel's rather than a near-enough proxy:
# `surrogatepass` would charge 3 bytes for each surrogate in the
# `surrogateescape` range that `os.fsencode` renders back as the SINGLE
# undecodable filename byte it came from, over-counting a path with non-UTF-8
# bytes in its name threefold and refusing a batch that fits.
#
# NOT a proof that the spawn fits, and the comment must not pretend otherwise.
# `execve` charges the inherited ENVIRONMENT against the same budget and
# `_comfy_env` forwards a copy of `os.environ`, which on a loaded shell is tens
# of KiB on its own; Windows does not work like this at all, capping the whole
# rendered command line at 32,767 UTF-16 code units. A ceiling that actually
# held under all of that would have to be computed per-spawn against the live
# environment, which is a different mechanism from a tool-argument guard. What
# these two DO buy is what the id caps buy: a runaway list is refused as a clean
# `ComfyCliError` naming the mistake, rather than reaching a spawn that fails
# with an unconverted `OSError`. Converting that `OSError` at the spawn site is
# the airtight backstop underneath them, and is tracked separately.
#
# The AGGREGATE is the one that binds in practice, and the count is the backstop
# under it rather than a second ceiling a caller meets. At a typical absolute
# path — `/home/user/Pictures/comfy-inputs/IMG_20260804_123456.png` is about 58
# bytes — 128 KiB is reached around 2,200 files, well before the 4096-entry cap,
# so that entry count is only reachable with short paths (a `/tmp/frames/NNNN.png`
# sequence is ~20 bytes and does fit). Read the count cap as what stops a list of
# a million tiny or empty strings, not as a promise that 4096 real files fit.
# Clearing these caps is not a promise the upload COMPLETES —
# `upload_file`'s 300s timeout is the binding constraint on a batch that large,
# and it is comfy-cli's transfer being timed, not this guard's business. A
# caller who does reach one is told to split the batch; the tool takes any
# number of files across several calls, so neither cap makes an upload
# impossible, only unbatched.

    message it rides in is unreadable. Same per-field cap the envelope errors use.
    :func:`_reject_option_like` renders through this too, which is what applies
    the bound to the module's widest echo: most of its call sites guard values
    with no length cap of their own.

    This quotes the fragment itself rather than leaving that to an ``!r`` at the
    call site, because the cap has to apply to what is actually RENDERED. ``repr``
    expands a control or non-printable character into a 4-to-10-character escape
    (``\\x00``, ``\\uXXXX``, ``\\U000XXXXX``), so clipping the raw text first and
    quoting after would let 500 such characters land as ~2000+ in the message —
    the bound would read as if it held while the field blew past it. Clipping the
    rendered form is what :func:`errors._render_error_details` does too.

    The source text is sliced BEFORE ``repr`` so an MB-sized value never
    materializes an expanded copy just to have it thrown away. That is safe for
    the characters shown: every source character contributes at least one
    character to the repr, so the escaping of the retained prefix cannot depend
    on anything past the cap. The one thing it does change is ``repr``'s choice
    of surrounding quote — it switches to double quotes for a string containing
    an apostrophe and no double quote, and that decision is now made over the
    slice, so an apostrophe past the cap flips it. Cosmetic, in a preview that
    is already truncated. The ellipsis is counted inside the cap, so the
    returned field never exceeds it.
